# Data Processing

This folder contains the code used for pre- and post-processing.

## Start up
The code was developed with Python version 3.9.
The used packages and their version number are listed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt).

To install the packages in you python (virtual) environment, use:

    pip install requirements.txt

Furthermore, to ensure that import of the self-created package goes correctly, do the following:

    cd src/
    pip -e install setup.py

This installs the [tusz_data_processing](src/tusz_data_processing/) 'package'.
