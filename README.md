# TNKF-LSSVM for Seizure Detection

Public repo for paper: 

## Code
The code in this repository is divided into two sections [classification](classification/) and [data_processing](data_processing/). 
- The `data_processing` section contains all the code used for pre- and post-processing (including feature extraction). This code is in Python.
- The `classification` section contains code for the TNKF-LSSVM classifier and the regular LS-SVM classifier (including LSVMlab code). This part of the code was done in MATLAB. 

The package dependencies of both code bases are listed in the respective folders.
